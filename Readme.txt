Spoof Proof (Spoof_Proof.py) is a “one-of-a-kind” anti ARP Spoofing tool. It detects any ARP poisoning/spoofing attempts, logs them, maintains a real-time view of whether your computer is being victimized and connections that have been affected by ARP poisoning, and finally logs the MAC address of the hacker machine that can be used for future forensics. 

run code on Windows machines
on MacOS you will be alerted if ARP Spoofed packets are detected (Supposedly, this is untested) but formatting of UI and population of cells will be wrong

***Code contains many development artifacts***

Spoofer.py is a script for sending spoofed packets
